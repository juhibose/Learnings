## 2. Power BI Components

| Component             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Power BI Desktop**  | Windows application for building reports and dashboards. Includes **Power Query** for data transformation and **DAX** for calculations. |
| **Power BI Service**  | Online platform to publish, share, and collaborate on dashboards. |
| **Power BI Gateway**  | Connects on-premises data sources to Power BI Service for scheduled refreshes. |
| **Power BI Mobile**   | Mobile app to view dashboards and reports on the go. |
| **Power BI Report Builder** | Used to create paginated reports (print-friendly). |
| **Power BI Embedded** | Embed Power BI dashboards into custom applications. |

## 3. Power BI Workflow

1. **Connect** â†’ Load data from Excel, CSV, SQL, APIs, etc.  
2. **Transform** â†’ Use Power Query to clean, filter, merge, and shape data.  
3. **Model** â†’ Build relationships between tables and optimize performance.  
4. **Visualize** â†’ Create dashboards and reports with interactive visuals.  
5. **Publish** â†’ Share reports using Power BI Service or embed into apps.

## 4. Key Concepts

### a. Power Query Editor (ETL Tool)
- Used for **data cleaning and transformation**.
- Actions you can perform:
  - Remove duplicates, blanks, and nulls  
  - Merge & append tables  
  - Pivot & unpivot data  
  - Change data types  

### b. Data Modeling
- Organize data into **tables and relationships**.
- **Star Schema** is preferred:
  - **Fact Table** â†’ Contains transactional data (e.g., sales, revenue).  
  - **Dimension Tables** â†’ Contains descriptive data (e.g., product, customer, region).  
- Types of connections:
  - **Import Mode** â†’ Data is stored locally for faster performance.  
  - **DirectQuery Mode** â†’ Data stays in the source for real-time analysis.

### c. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
DAX is a **formula language** for calculations and aggregations in Power BI.

**Types of DAX Expressions:**
1. **Calculated Columns** â†’ Row-level calculations stored in the table  
2. **Measures** â†’ Aggregations calculated on the fly  

**Common DAX Functions:**

| Function       | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `SUM()`        | Adds up all values in a column |
| `CALCULATE()`  | Changes the filter context of a calculation |
| `FILTER()`     | Returns a filtered table |
| `IF()`         | Implements conditional logic |
| `RELATED()`    | Fetches data from a related table |
| `TOTALYTD()`   | Calculates Year-To-Date totals |

**Example DAX Measures:**
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
Profit % = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Profit]), SUM(Sales[Revenue]), 0)
